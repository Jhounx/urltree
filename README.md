# URLTree

URLTree is a simple tool for generating a tree structure from a list of URLs. This tool is useful for visualizing URL hierarchies in a clear and organized way.

## Installation

To use URLTree, you will need to have Go (Golang) installed on your system. Follow these steps to install the tool:

```bash
# Clone this repository to your local system:
git clone https://github.com/Jhounx/urltree.git

# Navigate to the project folder:
cd urltree

# Build the Go code:
go build urltree.go
```

Now, you can run URLTree from the command line:

```bash
./urltree input_file
```

## Usage

To use URLTree, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a file containing your list of URLs, for example, `routes.txt`, with URLs listed one per line.

2. Execute URLTree, providing the URL file as an argument:

```bash
./urltree routes.txt
```

URLTree will generate a tree structure based on the provided URLs and display the output in the terminal.

## Output Example

The output generated by URLTree will look like this:

```
└─ https:
    └─ example.com
        ├─ home
        ├─ about
        ├─ blog
        │   ├─ post-1
        │   ├─ post-2
        │   └─ post-3
        └─ contact
```

This represents the hierarchy of URLs in the input file.
